Greed.\nHow can I grapple with my place on our planet?\nI write about the environment, I soak in all that I need to know, but then I continue.\nAs a human, always consuming.\nIt’s all that I know how to do\nIn the pursuit of happiness, this is my game\nI have done more harm than good\nTo the mother\nHow do I rectify all that has been done?\nIs it too late?\n<i>I can’t live</i>\n<i>Guilty</i>\n<i>About my human existence</i>\nI was not born guilty\nNo baby ever is\nI became it,\nAs I learned\nThe weight of decisions\nThe guilt came slow at first\nThen all at once\n<i>Is it better to live in blissful ignorance?</i>\nAt least then I live the lie\nIt cannot be\nI must end on a better note\nTo leave a sweet flavor in your mouth\n<i>I will overcome</i>\n<i>Make what is wrong right</i>\nI promise\n<i>I will do what I can</i>\nWhat can I do?\nI will try\n<i>Make what is wrong right</i>\nA love letter to dread\nCannot be the solution\nOptimism and dread\nAre inextricably linked\nI am fed dread\n“It will never happen”\n“It is not possible”\nAnd all I feel is hope\nA lost comfort\n<i>It can be done.</i>",
