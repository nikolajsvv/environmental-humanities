  "description": "Sometimes when dealing with big questions about our existence and how we affect the world around us it can be quite debilitating and hopeless. I often get caught up in the fact that I, as an individual, can not possibly make any real difference that would actually matter in the grand scheme of things. This free-verse poem explores those concepts and has helped me contemplate possible solutions to our big issue of creating a more sustainable society.",
