Worms and all their treasures.\nI think of this bustling city\nof roots, of mycelia\nand all the chattering they do.\nA black earthy night full of\nmineral stars.\n\n| S\n| E\n| Q\n| U\n| E\n| S\n| T\n| R\n| A\n| T\n| I\n| O\n| N\n\\/\n\nReach up and pull the upper world into your kingdom of hearts,\neater of death, master of rebirth,\nmidwife, mother, coroner, grave.\nI love you with the ferocity of your shaking, quaking earth,\nthe enormity of your troubled tectonics,\nwith the swift pull of the deepest ocean current.\n\nAll the poison you stomach in your massive living belly,\ngentle hiccups and burps away from disaster,\nand everything you suck from the air, sending up your vines and branches to chase after;\nthey are nothing against the size of your hunger\nor the ingenuity of your being.\n“Give it to me, give it to me!\nAll things live again.”\n\nTake from me my massive hope and fold it into reality. I am alive because I know what is in the soil.",
