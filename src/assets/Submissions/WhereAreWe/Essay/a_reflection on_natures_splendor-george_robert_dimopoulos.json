  "body": "It is the evening of a hot July day. With the orange rays of the setting sun illuminating the surrounding area, I sit silent as I admire nature’s song: the choir of cardinals chirping in the cattails, which peacefully sway with the inland breeze. I sway to the music, but not voluntarily; I am in a small bass boat in the middle of Portage Lake. Dipping my fishing pole slightly as I reel in the spinner bait on the end of the line, I peer into the clear water to see bulbous coontail swaying in the current.\n\nFor most of the summer, this was my younger self’s favorite way to pass time. I lived in my grandparents’ trailer in rural southwest Michigan for the majority of break, far away from the urban environment that I spent the rest of the year in. It would not be farfetched to assume that it was boring living without much technology as a member of Generation Z. However, quite the opposite proved to be true: it seemed as though a type of invisible calming force swept over the land. The stressors that engulfed me back at home always melted away as I took the two hour drive up northeast around Lake Michigan to Vicksburg.\n\nIn addition to fishing, another pastime I occupied myself with was exploring the forested area adjacent to the lake. With imposing pine trees overhead, my cousins and I were eager to explore all that the forest had to offer. I remember finding a stone bench in the middle of the forest, which seemed as though it had been left untouched for years. Upon further examination of the moss on the stone bench, I came across turkey tail mushrooms in the tree stump next to the bench. My cousins and I admired the multicolor appearance of the mushrooms; however, our gazes had been cut short due to our discovery of poison ivy underneath the bench!\n\nAlthough I have not been able to go to Michigan as frequently as I had when I was younger, my grandparents’ trailer still has a special place in my heart. I make the effort to visit my grandfather at least once or twice during my short time spent back home at the end of summer before Fall Quarter begins. After all these years, I still feel nature dipping my body into its calming aura. I could never imagine a world without this magical place. Unfortunately, this could become a reality in our near future.",
