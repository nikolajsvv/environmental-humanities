  "description": "This drawing represents my emotions related to our current environmental and social crisis. I am unable to put into words how I am experiencing such an overwhelming sense of despair and hope at the same time. This coexistence sends my mind into turmoil and I am swallowed into a state of disarray and uncertainty.\n\nIn the drawing you can see a path of sorts, running through a forest and at the end, a black hole. At the end of the path you see a figure, with no crisp edges, as if it is being slowly consumed by the void. This figure is me, the trees in the forest are the never ending number of issues that we need to tackle in order to maintain the glory of our natural world and the stability of our own society, and the void is where we are headed. The point of no return.",
