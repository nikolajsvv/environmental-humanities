  "content": "Humanity is facing large-scale environmental change: what scientists call the sixth mass extinction; unprecedented heat estimated to render nearly a fifth of the world uninhabitable in 50 years; increased drought, declining pollinators, extreme storms, food and water insecurity; the potential displacement of hundreds of millions; and threats to health, livelihoods, homes, lives – particularly for the planet’s most already-vulnerable populations and those who have contributed to these environmental crises the least.

Students reflect on our current moment in history, highlighting experiences with environmental change from various perspectives.",
