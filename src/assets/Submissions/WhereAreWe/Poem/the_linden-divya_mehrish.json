  "body": "Lips to creases, my tongue\nmeanders over crevices in peeling\nskin. The earth has crystallized\ninto jigsawed rings. We, learning\nto boil the air out of lungs, snap\nbrittleness out of keratin. I lose\nthe white of nails to slashes\nswimming between rivers of black—\nblack blood, dried into slits. I want\nto heal you, and so I grip your walls\nand peel the breast of your bark back—\npink baby skin, swollen with embraces,\nforgotten. You are ready to start\nagain. I pretend I haven’t starved\nyou as we fall into each other,\nlimbs tangling, murdered beast\nerect with the waiting to fall.",
  "description": "This poem, “The Linden,” is part of my collection entitled THIS EARTH, OUR WOUND. At the core of this project, I wanted to articulate my current relationship with environmental reckoning as well as reconciling my feelings of hope and hopelessness towards our planet, of grief and gratitude for this beautiful earth, in order to help initiate and sustain ongoing conversations in the Stanford community and beyond. Many of these poems touch on my own fascination with the relationship between humankind and the planet, and more specifically the intricate dynamic between the human body and the earth, and the space in between. I am most interested in thinking about the space that exists between our physical selves and the earth’s own physical self, and how we can bridge this gap to redefine humanity with more earthly qualities, to be more in touch with the ground we walk on, to taste the air we breathe with more curiosity, respect, and awe.",
