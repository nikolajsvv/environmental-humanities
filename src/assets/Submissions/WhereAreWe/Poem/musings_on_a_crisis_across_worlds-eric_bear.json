  "body": "Musings on a crisis across worlds\n\nA rotten rut in a routine that we all play into.\nA forgotten release from what we should do.\nAnd a weariness that nags like a bite under your skin.\n\nIt can be lonely, on an island of understanding.\nBut then, if so, why not share the weight and invite in.\nThe ones screens, lines, and idle minds push away.\n\nGrief is a friend who barrels through life without thinking,\nCalling unexpectedly but never placing its weight on the table.\nBut in the clear crisp jolt of shutters jerking me awake in the night.\n\nA massage ripples and restores, knowing what is built up.\nWhen entropy fills banks and brush with sod and junk.\nSo why cannot one release the ripples on their own?\n\nFall leaves decaying like Swiss cheese meld into renewal.\nFungal paths, a swath of a million open arms.\nTo shelter our grief and fuse it with others for reuse.\n\nTomorrow I’ll pound into the ground to remind me it’s there.\nThink if I can, but smile if I don’t, and dissolve the buildup,\nFor now there is work to do, so I’ll catch and release this, here.",
