  "body": "I was eight when the water cleansed the town.\nMy grandma’s busy moving our shelves and books.\nWe tried to save the first floor’s wooden boards.\n\nA month later we drove back to scrub the walls.\nMaybe a crocodile family found a home in the understair, electrocuted into an archive upon our arrival.\n\nWe went back to the rhythm of living, new beige painted over discoloured cement.\nFrom some angles, you can still see the waterline behind the cabinet.\n“Monsoon season” became a lap-lapping static noise homeward.\n\nMaybe if I was rainfed rice, the monsoon would be a celebration.\nIn the mud, my ankles quenched my thirst for solutions.\nI didn’t realise my belly burst into a case study of its own: wetland, fallow land, no land.\n\nJakarta, our neighbor, was no longer the capital.\nBangkok, built on subsiding clay, year on year, remained.\nDad told me Bangkok has been sinking for thirty years.\nThis is not thirty years ago.\n\nI don’t trust dams;\nThese days I live in morbid anticipation of when my plane to Suvanabhoomi may land on a rusted axe.",
