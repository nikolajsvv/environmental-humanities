  "content": "Expansive thinking and deep questioning are hallmarks of the environmental humanities – an interdisciplinary field that brings together the sciences and humanities to probe at the cultural, ethical, and philosophical roots of environmental challenges. In the first quarter of Stanford’s new Doerr School of Sustainability, students in “Environmental Humanities: Finding Our Place on a Changing Planet” [SUSTAIN 140 | BIO 184 | ENGLISH 140D] explored a range of questions around today’s accelerating environmental challenges – engaging interdisciplinary lenses and creativity. Students thought critically about narratives of human progress, explored contrasting cultural paradigms around human-nature relationships, and leveraged humility and curiosity to make sense of the ways culture and environmental change are entwined."
