  "description": "The Stanford Tree Project seeks to bring together bottom-up curious tree-lovers, top-down resource dissemination, and community. In the vein of bringing nature and appreciation for our environment as the place where we live, work, and play, our project illustrates the brilliance of trees on campus and student relationships with them.\n\n On Saturday, December 2nd from 2-3:30pm, we hosted the first (to our knowledge) student-run Tree Walk. In admiration of the Trees of Stanford Project, stewarded by Sairus Patel, and the X-Tree Project, run by Professor Noah Rosenberg, we gathered 17 folks across many backgrounds to simply enjoy trees.
