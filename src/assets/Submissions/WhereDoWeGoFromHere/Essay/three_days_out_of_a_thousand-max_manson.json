  "body": "In my pre-college education, the only outdoor education that was given was a 3 day camp in the mountains during fifth grade. The camp was great, we learned about the native plant and animal species, studied the geology of the area, hiked to an area devastated by wildfire, and more. The camp left me longing for more nature and actually sparked an interest in environmentalism among my friend group. We started an unofficial environmental club called “green leaf” and our 10-year-old minds had wild dreams of extreme measures of action to “save the environment,” as well as reasonable ones too.\n\nBut the thing is, of the over 1000 days of education I had through elementary, middle, and high school, only 3 were dedicated to outdoor education. What if we cared about this more? What if kids participated in outdoor education every year, and it was given the same importance as other primary school topics? How many more kids would feel a stronger connection to nature and be inspired to save this beautiful planet we call home?",
