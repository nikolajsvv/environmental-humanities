  "body": "The streets were all but depleted. Unrecognizable, torn up, shriveled, and mangled. Time did its job, and we were wise enough to let them rot. In their place, expansion joints ruptured, allowing cracks to reunite light with the soil beneath. As the asphalt and concrete fractured, the city goers replaced seeds where they ought to have been all along. And in the wake of drawn-out violence against the land, a partnered restoration towards green, careless, quiet began. Unusable to keep as of now, the roads werenâ€™t always that way. As though a clandestine band of disrupters lined the streets with tacks, the roads soon made their case for never being driven on again. Policies and  funding keeping the roads safe halted silently. And yet, the city need to rumble on, now with less gas powering its ways. Multi-passenger bikes and new human-powered contraptions roamed the in-tact sidewalks, which had now expanded to safely accommodate walkers and travelers of all  paces and abilities. A kinder superhighway of slower travel came into focus, morning movement and community interaction with collision rates higher than our car-crazed society of past. Out of love for seeing a friend while in transit walking to work, a parent steeps in deep breaths of calm. Out of gratitude for urban forest bathing on the walk to work, a citizen returns to work clear-minded. Out of sheer surrender to the ease and convenience of biking and walking, the city transforms its scars across the land into hybrid walkways for human and non-human species alike. Not because of money or because the world needed it, but for the need to continue living, this city evolved.",
